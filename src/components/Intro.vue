    <h3>Eat well and stay healthy</h3>
    <p>
      Struggling for breakfast or dinner inspiration? Leave it to us! To
      maintain a constant weight, our bodies have to burn the same amount of
      energy as they consume. What sounds easy in theory can be challenging in
      practice; people who eat more generally also have to do more exercise.
    </p>
    <h3>How much energy your body actually needs</h3>
    <p>
      Energy requirements vary with age, gender, body size and activity levels.
      The Energy Requirements Calculator estimates your daily energy
      requirements for good health based on what your body needs for breathing,
      circulating blood, digesting food (Basal Metabolic Rate - BMR) and
      physical activity. Enter your gender, age, height and body weight in the
      form.
