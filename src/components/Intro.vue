    <p>To maintain a constant weight, our bodies have to burn the same amount of energy as they consume. What sounds easy in theory can be challenging in practice; people who eat more generally also have to do more exercise.</p>
    <h3>How much energy your body actually needs?</h3>
    <p>Try our BMR calculator. Enter your gender, age, height and body weight in the form. The BMR calculator will then easily and quickly calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate. The BMR result in the table also takes into account your level of average physical activity.</p>
